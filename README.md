# Clean Architecture Note App

The CleanArchitectureNoteApp is a powerful note-taking application built using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. It follows the principles of Clean Architecture to maintain separation of concerns and ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase. The app utilizes Room, an SQLite database library, to handle saving, updating, and deleting notes, enabling full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## Features

- **Note Creation**: Create and save notes with a title and content.
- **Note Editing**: Update and modify existing notes seamlessly.
- **Note Deletion**: Delete unwanted notes with ease.
- **Note Listing**: View a list of all saved notes in the app.
- **Note Searching**: Search for specific notes using keywords or titles.
